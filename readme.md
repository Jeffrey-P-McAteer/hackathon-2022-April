# Hackathon Nonsense, April 2022 Edition

Plan:
 - build a python https server (vr/ar APIs are generally unavailable to http servers) that will:
    - Generate a self-signed ssl cert for a private IP
    - Serve a desktop/AR/VR web app
    - Serve a websocket comm ring the web app can use to keep state in sync across all connected devices (1 server == 1 "room")
    - Voice comm ring as well? May need to dip into WebRTC nonsense.
